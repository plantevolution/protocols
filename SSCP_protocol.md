Gel Preparation
---------------

Clean the glasses, spacers and combs very well with soap and water. Rinse thoroughly with water, then rinse with ethanol and dry. Assemble the gel sandwich (longer glass plate at bottom, spacers on margins, shorter glass plate at top; fix into clumps, place it vertically, align using an enclosed card, tighten; place on rubber, fix; insert combs in an inclined position).

Prepare the gel (2 gels of 20 cm):

Ingredient | Volume
---------- | ------
40% acrylamide/bis (37.5:1) | 14 ml
TBE buffer (10x) | 3.5 ml
Water | 54 ml
Total volume | 70 ml

to be added just before pouring the gel:

Ingredient | Volume
---------- | ------
ammonium persulfate (APS; 10%) | 350 μl
TEMED (tetramethylethylenediamine) | 55 μl

> It is important to prepare the APS just before use for a good polymerization. It is possible, however, to aliquot it in amounts of 350 µL and freeze them at -20 ˚C.

Mix gently by rotating the beaker. As soon as the APS and the TEMED are mixed together in the solution, the gel starts to polymerise. You thus need to proceed with the pouring quickly. Pour the gel between the glass plates using a syringe, insert combs properly. Wait 90 minutes for it to polymerise (leave the remaining of the gel in the beaker to confirm the polymerisation).

**Notes**

* Final polyacrylamide concentration: 8% (or can be adjusted to 6-8%).
* optional: you can add between 2-5% glycerol

## Prerun

Pour TBE (0.5x, stored at 4 °C) into chamber, start cooling (to 4 °C).  Remove combs carefully. Put the gel sandwich into a rack, pour TBE into wells and on top to check tightness. Insert into the chamber.  Prerun at 250 V for 30 minutes.

## Sample Preparation

Mix 4 μl of Stop solution (supplied or the following composition: 95 % formamide + 0.05 % bromophenol blue + 10 mM NaOH) and 1 μl of PCR product (or asymmetric PCR product). Denaturate for 5 minutes at 94 °C (in PCR cycler) and put on ice immediately.

## Gel Loading

Load 5 μl of denaturated sample per well. Migrate the gel at 250 V for 12-16 hrs (to be optimized) at 4 °C.

## Gel Staining

Stain the gels in 200 mL TBE (0.5x) solution supplemented by 5 µL of SYBR Gold or GelRed for 10 to 30 minutes (shaking slowly).  You need just enough TBE buffer to cover the gel. We found that it was useful to rince the gel 15 minutes in fresh TBE buffer before visualizing. Visualize the gel, excise bands with razor blade, let them dissolve in 40 μl of dd water overnight (in fridge). Use 4 μl of band eluate as template for reamplification.

## Asymetric PCR

It is very useful to do asymetric PCR (Rodríguez et al. 2011) so that only one DNA strand is visible on the gel instead of two. The idea is to first do a standard PCR and check the amplification on gel. Then another PCR, identical to the first except for the addition of a single primer, is done using 1 µL of the first PCR as template. 5 µL of this asymetric PCR can be run on a gel to confirm proper amplification.
