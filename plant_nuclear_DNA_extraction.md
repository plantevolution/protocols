# Plant Nuclear DNA extraction protocol
*Simon Joly, 2009*  
*This protocol is a modification of the Weigel lab protocol*

### Notes
* Quantities in the protocol are for 1 g of fresh leaf material, but it can easily be scaled up (easily to 5 g).
* I obtained ~ 3 µg (picogreen quantified) of nuclear DNA from 1 g of fresh Leavenworthia leaves.
* The use of a nanodrop is useful but gives a biased estimate of the yield. DNA obtained with this protocol gave a yield on the nanodrop that was 10 to 15 times higher than a picogreen method. 

## Protocol
1. Grind 1 g of leaves to fine powder in liquid nitrogen (N2) using a mortar and pestle. Transfer the powder to a polyethylene (15 or 50 ml depending of quantity of material) centrifuge tube. Add 7.5 ml of ice-cold Nuclei extraction buffer (with 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol).
The Weigel protocol uses 10 ml per 0.5 g. I don’t know how this affects the yield.
2. Mix thoroughly up and down for about 5 minutes (keep cold). You can use the vortex at a low speed.
3. Filter the solution through two layers of 20 µm Miracloth (CalBiochem) into an ice-cold 50 ml polyethylene centrifuge tube. You can squeeze the layers at the end.  

   >**Note**: At this point, you can use 10 ul of the filtered nuclei mixed with methylene blue to quantify and confirm the nuclei presence and number using a light microscope (X 100).
4. Add 1.5 ml of Lysis Buffer to the filtered suspension and mix gently for 2 minutes on ice.  

   >**Note**:This is for 7.5 ml of Nuclei extraction buffer. If you recovered much less solution after the filtration, adjust the amount accordingly to keep the same ratio.*
5. Centrifuge at 2000g at 4 ◦C for 10 minutes to pellet the nuclei. Discard the supernatant by pouring off. Be careful not to discard the nuclei.
6. Add 2 ml of CTAB extraction buffer (+ 10 µl of β-mercaptoethanol) to the nuclei pellet and mix well by swirling gently to re-suspend the pellet. The bottom-most part of the pellet is sometimes hard to re-suspend and you can use a pipet to detach it from the side of the tube. It seems that this hard part doesn’t need to be perfectly dissolved.  

   >**Note**:The Weigel protocol uses less CTAB. I think more CTAB is important to obtain a good yield. You might event want to add up to 4 ml of CTAB per gram of leaves for an optimal yield. Also, the Weigel protocol uses a 1X CTAB buffer; I am not sure how this influences the yield.*
7. Add 5 µl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) to the CTAB solution and incubate for 30 minutes at 60 ◦C.
8. Split the CTAB solution equally into three 1.5 ml polypropylene (eppendorf) tubes (~ 700 µl in each).
9. Add an equal volume (700 µl) of Chloroform/IsoAmylAlcohol (24:1). Mix by inverting for 10 minutes and centrifuge at max speed for 10 minutes (@ room temperature).
10. Transfer the upper layer (~ 650 ul) to a new 1.5 ml polypropylene (eppendorf) tube and add an equal volume (~ 650 µl) of ice cold Isopropanol and immediately mix by inverting 5-6 times. Store at -20 ◦C for 1-2 hours.
11. Pellet the DNA by centrifuging at maximum speed for 20 minutes at 4 ◦C.
12. Pour off the supernatant and try to remove as much liquid as possible.
13. Add 1 ml of Wash Buffer (room temperature) per tube. Detach the pellet by flicking the tube and allow wash the pellet by placing the tubes on a shaker at low speed for 1 hour.
14. Re-pellet the DNA by centrifuging at max. speed for 10 minutes at 4 ◦C. Pour-off the supernatant (be careful for not pouring off the pellet at this point. It is normally not well attached to the side of the tube). Try to remove as much liquid as possible.
15. Dry the pellet to remove all trace of Ethanol. This can be done by letting the tube open at room temperature for several hours or by spinning the tubes about 3 minutes in a vacuum centrifuge. The pellet should not smell ethanol or anything else at this point.
16. Re-suspend the DNA pellet in 50-100 µl of sterile DNase free water. Pipet up and down several times to allow complete re-suspension.
17. Incubate the DNA at 65 ◦C for 20 minutes to destroy any DNases and store DNA at -20 ◦C.
